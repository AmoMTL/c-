# Project overview

*   Your solution must include either a `do-while` or `while` iteration.
    
*   Before the iteration block: your solution must use a `Console.WriteLine()` statement to prompt the user for an integer value between 5 and 10.
    
*   Inside the iteration block:
    
    *   Your solution must use a `Console.ReadLine()` statement to obtain input from the user.
    *   Your solution must ensure that the input is a valid representation of an integer.
    *   If the integer value isn't between 5 and 10, your code must use a `Console.WriteLine()` statement to prompt the user for an integer value between 5 and 10.
    *   Your solution must ensure that the integer value is between 5 and 10 before exiting the iteration.
*   Below (after) the iteration code block: your solution must use a `Console.WriteLine()` statement to inform the user that their input value has been accepted.
